This repository contains my solutions to all exercises from the [Cyfrin Rust Programming Basics Course](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/rust-programming-basics).

The course introduces Rust fundamentals with a focus on building a strong foundation for blockchain development, including Rust-based smart contracts and decentralized applications.
